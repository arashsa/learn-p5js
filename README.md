# Code examples

This is the code examples from the book P5JS - Interactive Visual Coding for the Web. You can find the book here: https://www.gitbook.com/book/arashsa/learn-p5js-visual-coding-for-the-web/details.

### How to use?

To run the examples change the path to the sketch in the index.html file. Change the line ```<script src="2-shapes/shapes.js"></script>``` to point to the JavaScript file that you want to run. As it is now it points to the shapes.js file under the 2-shapes directory.
