# Code examples

This is the repository for the code examples from the book P5JS - Interactive Visual Coding for the Web: https://www.gitbook.com/book/arashsa/learn-p5js-visual-coding-for-the-web/details.

### How to use?

To run the examples change the path of the sketch you want to run in the index.html file. To do this change the line ```<script src="2-shapes/shapes.js"></script>``` to point to the JavaScript file that you want to run.
